GeneticsLib
===========

My first test of genetic algorythm library

the purpose of the GeneticsLib is to create a library that will use genetic algorythms in neural networks.
it is not better in any way than the other libraries. it is just for testing and for me to improve my proggraming skills and 
understanding of genetic algorythms.

you may use the library as you want and i would gladly hear any sugestions. but i am not responsible for anything bad that
happens because of your direct or indirect use or interaction with my library.

if you do find it usefull i would like to hear about it. 

for 20/9/2014 the library is not even ready, ill update.
